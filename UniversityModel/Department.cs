/*University with Faculties and Departments (Composition and Aggregation)
Description: Create a University with multiple Faculty members and Department objects.Model it so that the University and its Departments are in 
a composition relationship(deleting a university deletes all departments), and the Faculty members are in an aggregation relationship 
(faculty can exist outside of any specific department).
Tasks:
● Define a University class with Department and Faculty classes.
● Demonstrate how deleting a University also deletes its Departments.
● Show that Faculty members can exist independently of a Department.
Goal: Understand the differences between composition and aggregation in modeling complex hierarchical relationships.*/
